Project Description
---
This project is the code for a thermostat that imitates the climate control unit found in most buildings. It uses green and red LEDs to simulate heating and cooling. A temperature sensor is used to determine whether the system needs to heat or cool based on a set desired temperature. The thermostat can also connect to a remote device (another thermostat) and exchange information with it.

The thermostat is built with an Arduino Uno, and Avr-gcc compiler is used to compile C on the Arduino.
